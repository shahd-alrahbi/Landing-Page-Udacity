# Landing Page Project
One way to use JavaScript to change the DOM is as demonstrated by the Landing Page Project, which does the following:

- Developing new components that resemble the styles and main menu.
- Modifying functionality and styling for items that are active and inactive.
- On-click automatic scrolling.

## Table of Contents


- A dynamically generated navigation menu on the header that will automatically adjust to the number of sections added to `index.html'.
- In the navigation menu, select the relevant area, and the page will immediately scroll to it.
- To display their active status, the activated part and its peer in the navigation menu alter their designs.
- The area that was previously enabled and its peer revert to their original look.


## Instructions

- The original `index.html` and `css/styles.css` are provided by [Udacity].
- The original `index.html` provided by [Udacity] has 3 sections and 3 other sections were added to test the functionality of adding new navigation menu items automatically.
- All other development features -including CSS new rules- are done in `js/app.js`.
- Developed by [Shahd Alrahbi] - a JavaScript Project Submission.
